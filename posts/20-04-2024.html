        <p>- Fixed a bug in Groups allowing a group owner to join another group</p>

        <p>- Fixed "Can't accept group invitation" bug</p>
        <p>- Fixed missing response for logs channel configuration</p>
        <p>- Channel is now shown for a deleted message (logs)</p>

        <p>If you're noticing a bug, or something unusual, report at <code>/survey</code></p>
        
        <h3>A little announcement</h3>
        <p>With the recent feature announced "User apps", it is a pleasure to announce that there will be a Miyuchan app "Miyuchan Pocket", a Miyuchan edition to have Miyuchan everywhere on discord. Miyuchan Pocket will have some features from the original one, but also bonus features as it is a different edition. For example, you will be able to gain global levels everywhere and more!</p>
